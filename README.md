# swarm_robot_simulation
A swarm robot simulation environment for ROS Indigo to be used with Gazebo.

## What's inside
*swarm_robot_simulation* contains packages each of which works on a set of functionalities of this simulation.

One package will describe the robot model, like a simple two-wheeled swarm robot, and also the gazebo environment setting files before running other nodes.

One package will simulate the physical properties of one swarm robot, like actuation, communication and sensing capabilities.

One package will be the testing field for different control algorithms.

## Setup


## Demo tests


## Motivation
This project starts after investigating several swarm robot platforms like Kilobot, Jasmine, E-puck, Alice, and work with [Inchbot](http://www.case.edu/mae/robotics/#modular) for a while, it would be interesting to see what these swarm microrobots can do as a collective under simulation environment like ROS. It's also for the purpose of learning various tools and programming in ROS.
