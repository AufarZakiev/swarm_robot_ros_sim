# swarm_robot_ros_sim
A swarm robot simulation environment for ROS Indigo to be used with Gazebo.

## What's inside
*swarm_robot_ros_sim* contains packages each of which works on a set of functionalities of this simulation.

One package will describe the robot models, one simple model could be a two-wheel cubic robot, and also the gazebo environment setting files and launch files.

One package will contain the costomized messages and services that will be used in other packages.

One package will contain simulators for physical properties, including actuation, communication and sensing capabilities.

One package will be the place in which different control algorithms reside.

## Motivation
This project starts after investigating several swarm robot platforms like Kilobot, Jasmine, E-puck, Alice, etc, and work on a novel swarm microrobot called [Inchbot](http://www.case.edu/mae/robotics/#modular) for a while, it would be interesting to see what these swarm microrobots can do as a collective under simulation environment like ROS. It's also for the purpose of learning various tools and programming in ROS.
