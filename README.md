# swarm_robot_simulation
A swarm robot simulation environment for ROS Indigo to be used with Gazebo.

## What's inside
*swarm_robot_simulation* contains packages each of which works on a set of functionalities of this simulation. One robot model package describes 

Robot model description, physical

physical simulation environment for swarm robot, including modularized actuation, communication and sensing capabilities for each inchbot

## Quick test


## Motivation
This project starts after investigating several swarm robot platforms like Kilobot, Jasmine, E-puck, Alice, and work with [Inchbot] [http://www.case.edu/mae/robotics/#modular] for a while, it would be interesting to see what these swarm microrobots can do as a collective under simulation environment like ROS. It's also for the purpose of learning various tools and programming in ROS.
